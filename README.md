# hello-world

Hello my good people. 

Currently speedrunning studying to greatly expand my software engineering skills and capabilities.

I'm on a mission to read all of Django's documentation in its entirety as well as Python's documentation and several others.

I am absolutely determined to do all that I can to become the best developer I can possibly be.

In the process of mastering:
Python
Django
Node.js
Javascript
RESTful API's
and more. 

End goal is to become highly effective at developing high quality software at a fast pace while producing detailed documentation, testing and optimization. 

I'm extremely excited.
